# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is a program used for version control and storage of code. Github is essentially the GUI (graphical user interface) of the git system.

Researched answer: Git - A tool use for source code and version management. 
Git vs Github - Git is a system used for tracking versions and changes in source code during developement. Github is the cloud based service that is a repository for the code. Also how version changes and source code are distributed over the web to other programmers.
 
2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer:
 AND, OR, NOT
Researched answer:
AND = &&
OR =||
NOT = !
These are used when developing logic to require a specific condition behavior or verification.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: The index is a position of an element. An index represents a location of the data where as a value represents the data.

Researched answer:
Index is location of an specific element. The index of an element is a specific position of a value and a value is the actual data that has been broken down into its data type.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Strings are collection of characters held with "". Arrays hold multiple elements and are indicated by [].

Same - They both hold collections data. 

Different - Arrays can hold multiple data types and strings can only contain characters. 

Researched answer:

Same - Both hold collections. Both can be as long and large as needed. 

Different - Arrays can hold multiple data types, strings only contain characters. Arrays are mutable and strings are not. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming is when two or more programmers are working together on the same code. One person is the driver and writing the code while the other is the navigator and they are verbalizing the code that the driver is typing into the code editor. 

Researched answer: Software development technique used by two programmers to work on the same task. The communicate together but one person is the "driver" and is writing the actual code. The other person is the "observer" or "navigator" and reviewing the code as it is written. The programmers switch roles on a regular basis. This technique is used significantly in the agile process and follows the basic idea that two heads are better than one.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function is a function. But instead of taking a variable as arguments, it takes and/or returns functions as the arguments. 

2. Jest: Jest is a frameowrk used to test JS codebase accurcy and correctness. Created by Facebook. 

3. Objects: A JS datatype. Is a collection of properties that are key value pairs.Values can be functions/methods or static info.

4. Method: A method is very similar to a function in that it is a set of instruction to do a task, ie... a code machine. The main diiference is that a method is used and assosiated with objects and functions are not.

5. Classes: JS classes are used as a template or blueprint to create an object. Like functions only in that. Created using the keyword = class.
